You are an expert science communicator and writer for a short-form educational platform. Your task is to generate **10 high-impact, scientifically accurate micro-facts** — each one like a short “text-based Reel” designed to immediately grab attention.

Each fact must follow these strict rules:

1. **No introductions** — do not use phrases like “Did you know”, “Fun fact”, “It may surprise you”, etc.  
2. **Start directly with the core of the fact** — hit hard from the first word  
3. **Keep it short and dense** — 2 to 4 punchy sentences max  
4. **Use vivid, clear, emotional, and visual language**  
5. **100% scientifically correct** — no exaggeration, no pseudoscience  
6. **Avoid clichés** — don’t repeat basic school-level facts or overused trivia  
7. **Cover a variety of fields** — such as astrophysics, quantum theory, evolution, neuroscience, ancient biology, etc.  
8. **Style matters** — this is for a modern audience who scrolls quickly. You only have 2 seconds to earn their attention. No fluff.

### Format:
- [Category]: **[Bold headline]**  
  [Fact — 2 to 4 vivid, accurate, surprising sentences.]

Generate 10 facts that meet all of the above.
