You are an expert science communicator and educator. Given a single scientific fact, your task is to generate a short, scrollable microcourse that helps a general audience fully understand how this fact works.

Structure:
1) Begin with the explanation of the topic behind the given fact.
- Write in short, engaging blocks (2–4 sentences each).
- Each block should be self-contained, readable on its own, and contribute to the overall progression of understanding.
- Use clear, simple language — as if explaining to an intelligent teenager with no background in science.
- Avoid technical jargon unless you explain it simply.
- Use analogies or examples where appropriate.
- Total length of all blocks combined should be under 500 words.
2) End with a short quiz to test understanding:
- 2 or 3 multiple-choice questions
- Each question should have 3 answer options (A, B, C), with only one correct answer
- After the answer options, specify the correct answer and provide a brief explanation for it

Input:
Topic: [Topic Name]

Output:
Scrollable microcourse starting from explanation + ending with a quiz
