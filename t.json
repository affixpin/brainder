The more similar the DNA sequences, the closer the genetic relationship between two organisms."},{"type":"text","content":"**Block 3:**  \nThe fact that humans and bananas share half of their DNA underscores the concept of a common ancestry. It means that at some point in evolutionary history, humans and bananas diverged from a common ancestor, which is why we see similarities in their genetic makeup."},{"type":"text","content":"**Block 4:**  \nThis genetic similarity between humans and bananas highlights the interconnectedness of all life on Earth.
