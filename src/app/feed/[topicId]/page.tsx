      type: 'text',
      content: 'We can\'t see black holes directly (they\'re black, after all!), but we can spot them by watching how they affect their surroundings:\n\n1. They bend light from stars behind them\n2. They make nearby stars orbit around seemingly nothing\n3. They create powerful jets of radiation when eating stars'
