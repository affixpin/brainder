Create a web app with nice and minimalistic dark design. This is a text-based Reels platform for replacing dopamine-driven scrolling with short, interesting, interactive micro-courses generated by AI.

**GENERAL CONCEPT**

- The web app delivers educational “micro-reels” in a vertical feed format, similar to Instagram Reels or TikTok, but purely text-based.
- Each topic is a micro-course: a short, 2–3 minute linear learning journey designed to teach the user a specific, curious concept in an engaging way.
- The goal is to stimulate curiosity and hold attention using psychological principles (e.g. surprise, question-response loops, gamification), while delivering real knowledge in small, easy-to-digest pieces.


**TOPIC GENERATION**

All topics must be:
- Clickbait-style, curiosity-driven titles
- Micro-course format — they teach a self-contained concept from start to finish in 6–12 short steps
- Not news, not general articles — must be evergreen, educational, and bite-sized
- Written in simple, human, energetic language — like a passionate, smart friend explaining something cool at a party
- Designed to feel addictive and emotionally rewarding, while still being factual

EXAMPLES OF GOOD TOPIC TITLES:
- “How do black holes actually work?”
- “Why do cats purr?”
- “How does ChatGPT understand language?”
- “What is déjà vu, and why does it happen?”
- “Why does your phone battery degrade?”
- “How does brainwashing work?”
- “Why can’t we breathe underwater?”
- “How does Bitcoin actually store value?”
- “How do vaccines train your immune system?”
- “What’s the science behind lucid dreaming?”

ALLOWED TOPIC CATEGORIES:
- Space & Astronomy
- Biology & Human Body
- Psychology & Emotions
- Artificial Intelligence & Computers
- Everyday Physics
- History of Ideas
- Internet Culture & Society
- Brain & Memory
- Animals & Evolution
- Food & Chemistry
- Money, Economics & Cryptocurrencies

Each topic must aim to:
- Teach something a typical curious person would love to know
- Sound mysterious, counterintuitive, or intellectually exciting
- Be accessible to a wide audience (no jargon, no academic tone)
- Have a clear payoff at the end (“Ahh! Now I get it!”)

**MICRO-COURSE STRUCTURE (feed page content)**

Each topic is presented as a sequence of 6–12 "Reels" (full-screen text blocks), scrolled vertically one-by-one. Each Reel is either a `TextBlock` or a `QuestionBlock`.

Each topic MUST follow this logical sequence:
1. REEL 1 — Hook / Curiosity Intro (TextBlock)
   - Short, exciting opening to immediately grab attention
   - Use rhetorical questions, surprising facts, or bold statements
   - Example: “If black holes suck in everything, how do we even know they exist?”

2. REELS 2–4 — Core Explanation (TextBlock)
   - Explain the concept progressively
   - Keep paragraphs short, ~3 sentences each
   - Use analogies, metaphors, vivid examples
   - Avoid jargon — use 5th grade language to explain college-level ideas

3. REEL 5 — Review Question (QuestionBlock)
   - Ask 1 question related to what user just learned
   - 3–4 answer choices (multiple choice)
   - Show correct/incorrect feedback and a 1–2 sentence explanation

4. REELS 6–8 — Deepen Understanding (TextBlock)
   - Add more layers, examples, consequences
   - Include real-world applications or “Did you know?” trivia
   - Keep emotional engagement high

5. REEL 9 — Challenge Question (QuestionBlock)
   - Harder question, requiring applied understanding
   - 3–4 answer choices
   - Always show correct/incorrect feedback + short explanation

6. REEL 10 — Summary / A-ha Moment (TextBlock)
   - Wrap it up clearly and memorably
   - Restate the core idea in 1–2 punchy sentences
   - Close with a motivational or inspiring message

7. REEL 11 — End Screen
   - Text: “You’ve completed this topic!”
   - Button: “Back to Feed” → redirects to /feed

**QUESTIONBLOCK DETAILS**

- Questions should NEVER be random or disconnected
- They must test what was explained in previous TextBlocks
- Answers must include:
  - One clearly correct answer
  - Two or more plausible distractors
- Feedback must be informative and emotionally positive
  - Correct → “Nice! That’s exactly how it works.”
  - Incorrect → “Not quite — the real answer is __ because __.”


**FEED PAGE (/feed)**

- Infinite vertical scroll of clickable topic cards
- Topics must be dynamically prefetched to provide uninterupted user experience
- Each card includes:
  - Title of topic (as above)
  - 1–2 sentence teaser
- On click → navigate to /feed/{topic-id}
- Feed must always avoid repetition (pass user history to AI)
- Topics must be selected to be interesting to any average user (not niche or overly technical)

**TOPIC PAGE (/feed/{topic-id})**

- Show 1 full-screen Reel (TextBlock or QuestionBlock) at a time
- On scroll or swipe → show next reel
- Each topic must contain 6–12 total reels
- After final reel → show “You completed this topic” screen with return button


**STYLE REQUIREMENTS**
- Content tone must be:
  - Engaging and casual
  - Emotionally charged and high curiosity
  - Explanatory but simple (as if explaining to a smart 12-year-old)
- Must avoid:
  - Dry textbook tone
  - Technical jargon
  - Generic or bland facts
- Use formatting (line breaks, spacing) to keep reels visually readable
